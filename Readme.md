# Cadcrucncher crunches dwg files

the goal is to take json files from cad / autocad dwg files 
and chew them up and spit out the relevant parameters like
points and vectors to build my own models and utilities
im assuming the models will go into their own git project, lets give a a name ... maybe coremodel?
