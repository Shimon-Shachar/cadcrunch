# Cadcrucncher crunches dwg files

the goal is to take json files from cad / autocad dwg files 
and chew them up and spit out the relevant parameters like
points and vectors

then build a simple building element models and use relevent parameters to inform the model just to test

lastly use all parameters to build models with help (minimal) from 
user
